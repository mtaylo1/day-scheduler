# Name:  
Day Scheduler - Mustapha Taylor    

# Description
The Workday Scheduler is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript application that provides a color-coded hourly schedule from 9 AM to 5 PM for managing daily tasks. Users can enter events into time blocks that dynamically update colors based on the current time. The app saves user input on the client-side using localStorage, ensuring data persistence even after page refreshes or browser closures.
